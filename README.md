This repository contains the code used for the MSc thesis to obtain the MSc degree in Data Science and Engineering, titled: "Data-centric models for the sustainable development of the multimodal Sines-Madrid transport corridor".
The code is divided into 3 files "paper_chegada.ipynb" "paper_partida.ipynb" corresponding to the model evaluation and forecast for freight movements entering and leaving the port of Sines, respectively.
The "gr√°ficos.ipynb" contains the analysis and graphs made based on the values extracted from the code files mentioned before.
